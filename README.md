# UW_homework_4

This repository has an index.html and an javascript.js file to excute the functions

This operates by having multiple divs that are hidden and shown throughout the quiz. The user can then redo the quiz as all the variables are reset and the quiz can be retaken

Each high score is saved as a new array push to the local storage. It is then loaded and looped through to add a new table row with score and name. The highest score(s) are show with a blue row.
